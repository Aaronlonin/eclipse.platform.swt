<h2>
<b>Example - Example Launcher</b></h2>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
This example serves as a launchpad for accessing the SWT examples in the system.
It also informally demonstrates a mechanism for opening views and launching applications
programmatically from within the Eclipse Platform.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Running the example</h3>
To run the Controls Example, pull down the Perspective menu, select the
Show View menu item, then select Other from the submenu.&nbsp; A dialog
will come up with a list of views.&nbsp; Expand SWT Examples and select
the view named Launcher.&nbsp; A view containing a list of examples to
choose will appear.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Details</h3>
The example launcher view contains a tree list, a text area, and 2 buttons.
<p>The tree list contains a list of all the SWT examples you can choose
to run.&nbsp; When an example is selected from the tree, the text area
shows a short description of each example.&nbsp; The selected example can
be executed by clicking on the Run button, which can be found just below
the tree list.&nbsp; For some of the examples, you can add the example
code to a project in the Workspace.&nbsp; A project, with a name specified
by the user, is created and all the java classes required to run that example
will be added to that newly created project.

Depending on the configuration of your system, it may be necessary to alter
the build paths or to define classpath variables in order to locate Eclipse Platformcomponents.
