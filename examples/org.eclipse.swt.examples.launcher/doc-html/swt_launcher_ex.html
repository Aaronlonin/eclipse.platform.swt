   <title>SWT - Example Launcher</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Example Launcher</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Example Launcher is a tool for enumerating, running and browsing a variety of examples.
While these operations may be performed manually (with some difficulty), the Example Launcher
offers a convenient interface.&nbsp; For information on how to manipulate particular examples
manually, please consult their related documentation.
</p>

<h3>Running the Example Launcher</h3>
<p>To run the Example Launcher, pull down the Perspective menu, select the
Show View menu item, then select Other from the submenu.&nbsp; A dialog
will come up with a list of views.&nbsp; Expand SWT Examples and select
the view named SWT Example Launcher.&nbsp; A view containing a list of examples to
choose will appear.
</p>

<h3>About the examples</h3>
<p>The Example Launcher can launch two different types of examples: Workbench Views,
and Standalone applications.&nbsp; Examples will generally be organized into categories to
distinguish the one from the other.
</p>
<p>Workbench Views are GUI panels that sit inside a given perspective.  When the Launcher
starts a program that is written to interact with the Workbench as a view, it is opened and
embedded into the currently active perspective.
</p>
<p>Standalone applications are programs that run independently of the current
Eclipse Platform environment.&nbsp; First, a new Java VM and Eclipse Platform runtime
is started, then the application's main() method is invoked.&nbsp; For this reason,
these applications may take some time to load.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The example launcher view contains a tree list, a text area, and 2 buttons.
The tree list contains a list of all the SWT examples you can choose
to run.&nbsp; When an example is selected from the tree, the text area
shows a short description of each example.&nbsp; The selected example can
be executed by clicking on the Run button, which can be found just below
the tree list.&nbsp; For some of the examples, you can also import the example
source code into a project in the Workspace.&nbsp; A project, with a name specified
by the user, is created and all the java classes required to run that example
will be added to that newly created project.
</p><p>
Depending on the example and on the configuration of your system, it may be
necessary to alter Project build paths or to define classpath variables to compile
or run examples that have been imported to the Workspace.
