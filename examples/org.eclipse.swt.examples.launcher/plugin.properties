	A collection of Standard Widget Toolkit examples that run as Views inside the Eclipse Platform.  \
	These examples will create a new View in the current Perspective.

launchitem.LauncherExample.name = Launcher
launchitem.LauncherExample.description = \
	This example serves as a launchpad for accessing the SWT examples in the system.  \
	It also informally demonstrates a mechanism for opening views and launching \
	applications programmatically from within the Eclipse Platform.\n\n\
	The example launcher view contains a tree list, a text area, and 2 buttons.  \
	The tree list contains a list of all the SWT examples you can choose to run.  \
	When an example is selected from the tree, the text area shows a short description of each example.  \
	The selected example can be executed by clicking on the Run button, which can be found just below the tree list.  \
	For some of the examples, you can also import the example code into a project in the Workspace.  \
	A project, with a name specified by the user, is created and all the java classes \
	required to run that example will be added to that newly created project.\n\n\
	Depending on the configuration of your system, it may be necessary to alter the \
	build paths or to define classpath variables in order to locate Eclipse Platform components.
