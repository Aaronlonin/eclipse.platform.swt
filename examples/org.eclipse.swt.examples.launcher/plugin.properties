launchitem.LauncherExample.description = It also informally demonstrates a mechanism for opening views and launching applications programmatically from within the Eclipse Platform.  The example launcher view contains a tree list, a text area, and 2 buttons.  The tree list contains a list of all the SWT examples you can choose to run.  When an example is selected from the tree, the text area shows a short description of each example.  The selected example can be executed by clicking on the Run button, which can be found just below the tree list.  For some of the examples, you can add the example code to a project in the Workspace.  A project, with a name specified by the user, is created and all the java classes required to run that example will be added to that newly created project.  Depending on the configuration of your system, it may be necessary to alter the build paths or to define classpath variables in order to locate Eclipse Platform components.
