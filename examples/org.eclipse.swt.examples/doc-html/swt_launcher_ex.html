<h2>SWT Example Launcher</h2>

<p>
The Example Launcher is used to launch SWT examples which can either be Workbench Views, 
or Standalone applications.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Workbench Views are examples that are integrated into Eclipse.  When the Launcher
starts a Workbench View, it is opened in the currently active perspective.
<li>Standalone applications are launched in a separate window.
</ul>

<p>
For information on how to run the standalone examples without the SWT Example Launcher, 
refer to <a href="swt_manual_setup.html">Manual Setup</a>.
</p>
<p>
The SWT workbench view examples can also be launched directly without using the SWT Example 
Launcher.  SWT workbench view examples can be found under the SWT Examples category of the 
Show Views dialog.
</p>

<h3>Running the Example Launcher</h3>

<p>
From the Window menu, select Show View --> Other. 
In the Show View dialog, expand SWT Examples and select the SWT Example Launcher view. 
A view containing a list of examples will appear in your current perspective.
Select an example from the list.  A brief description of the example is displayed.
Click on the Run button to launch the example.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The example launcher view contains a tree list, a text area, and a button.
The tree list contains a list of all the SWT examples you can choose
to run. When an example is selected from the tree, the text area
displays a short description of the example. The selected example can
be launched by clicking on the Run button.  Standalone examples are run in the 
same thread as the workbench's UI but they are not integrated into the perspective. 
The launcher invokes the <code>open()</code> method of the standalone example.
