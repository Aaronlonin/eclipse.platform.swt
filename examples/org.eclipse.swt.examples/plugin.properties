plugin.SWTStandaloneExampleSet.name = SWT Standalone Examples Plugin

launchcategory.SWTStandaloneExamples.name = Standalone
launchcategory.SWTStandaloneExamples.description = A collection of Standard Widget Toolkit examples that run independant of the Eclipse Platform.  These examples may take a moment to start while a new runtime environment is created in the background.

launchitem.AddressBook.name = Address Book
launchitem.AddressBook.description = The AddressBook example shows how the org.eclipse.swt.Table class can be used to present tabular information.

launchitem.FileViewer.name = File Viewer
launchitem.FileViewer.description = The File Viewer example shows how a simple application can be implemented using SWT.  This application provides the ability to browse files and folders and manipulate via Drag & Drop.  It includes the use of alternate threads for long actions and demonstrates the use of the Tree, Table and Toolbar.

launchitem.HoverHelp.name = Hover Help
launchitem.HoverHelp.description = This example demonstrates how to implement custom hover help feedback using the MouseTrackListener.  Normally one would use the setToolTipText() feature and let SWT deal with displaying it at the appropriate time.   This example demonstrates that it is possible to create custom hover help of an arbitrary form, perhaps including images, live updated information or user interface hover-buttons.

launchitem.HelloWorld1.name = Hello World (1)
launchitem.HelloWorld1.description = This example demonstrates the minimum amount of code required to open an SWT Shell and process the events.

launchitem.HelloWorld2.name = Hello World (2)
launchitem.HelloWorld2.description = This example builds on HelloWorld1 and demonstrates the minimum amount of code required to open an SWT Shell with a Label and process the events.

launchitem.HelloWorld3.name = Hello World (3)
launchitem.HelloWorld3.description = This example builds on HelloWorld2 and demonstrates how to resize the Label when the Shell resizes using a Listener mechanism.

launchitem.HelloWorld4.name = Hello World (4)
launchitem.HelloWorld4.description = This example builds on HelloWorld2 and demonstrates how to resize the Label when the Shell resizes using a Layout.

launchitem.HelloWorld5.name = Hello World (5)
launchitem.HelloWorld5.description = This example builds on HelloWorld1 and demonstrates how to draw directly on an SWT Control.

launchitem.ImageAnalyzer.name = Image Analyzer
launchitem.ImageAnalyzer.description = The ImageAnalyzer opens image files and displays the visual contents of the file along with a summary of the data in the image file.  The user can make adjustments to various elements of the image such as scaling and Alpha blending and can save these changes to file.
