Setting the classpath:
----------------------

To compile this project you need to set the classpath specific for your operating and windowing system.
For this, rename one of the following files to .classpath.

* .classpath_win32 - Windows
* .classpath_cocoa - Mac OS
* .classpath_gtk - Linux and all Unix variants

To see these files you may have to remove the filter for .file in the Project Explorer.
Use the view menu and Custimize View entry for this.
