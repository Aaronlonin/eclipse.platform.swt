<h2>SWT Example - Paint Tool</h2>

<p>	
This example demonstrates the use of SWT graphics operations in the form of a
rudimentary bitmap painting program.  The Airbrush Tool implementation also 
demonstrates a mechanism for managing timed GUI operations in the background 
that are triggered by user input.
</p>
<p>	
Select a tool with which to draw in the drawing area.  There are a number of tools
to choose from on the toolbar.  To change the color selection, click on a color in the
palette below the drawing area: left-click for the foreground color, right-click for the
background color.
</p>
<p>
Uses SWT's GC and FontDialog, and JFace's InputDialog and action set support.
</p>

<h3>Running the example</h3>

<p>From the Window menu select Show View --> Other.  
In the Show View dialog, expand SWT Examples and select the
view named Paint.  A view titled Paint will appear in your current perspective.
