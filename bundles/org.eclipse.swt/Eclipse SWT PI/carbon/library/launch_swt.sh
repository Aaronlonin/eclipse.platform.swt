# This script wrappers a SWT based Java application on the fly as an
# application bundle and launches it.
#
# Why is it necessary?
# When using Carbon via JNI some magic is necessary to make MacOS X
# recognize the Java program as a 'real Mac application' with its own menu bar 
# and an entry in the Dock. Since this 'magic' does not seem to be public and
# documented API I don't know how to call it from the SWT startup code.
# As a workaround I've tried to simulate what ProjectBuilder or MRJAppBuilder
# do if they launch a SWT based Java application.
#
# How is it used?
# Basically by replacing the standard Java VM ('/usr/bin/java') with this script.
# Since this script is a replacement for the VM it takes roughly the same arguments.
# 
# Detailled steps:
# - adapt the value of the shell variable SWT_DLL below. (I have it point to the
#   folder where the Ant export script 'make_carbon.xml' places it).
# - create a "fake" jdk by creating a folder 'swt_jdk' somewhere on your disk
# - inside swt_jdk create a folder 'bin'
# - copy this script into 'bin' and rename it to 'java' (or make a symbolic link 'java'
#   from this file in your workspace)
# - make sure the script 'java' is executable
# - within Eclipse create a new JRE 'SWT VM' in 'Preferences/Java/Installed JREs'
# - When creating a new Launch or Debug Configuration on the JRE tab select your
#   new 'SWT VM' instead of the standard one
# - Now you can run or debug your application (however you will have to bring it
#   to front manually).

#
# Place of the SWT dll.
