&nbsp;1. Known Issues
<h3>
99.1 Known Issues</h3>
<h4>
99.1.1 Wheel Mouse</h4>

SWT does not directly handle the extended messages sent by the wheel mouse.
If the correct driver is installed for the wheel mouse, the extended messages are mapped to 
cursor operations that are supported.

<h4>
99.1.2 Resource usage on Windows 98</h4>

Although SWT is not inherently a heavy consumer of Windows GDI resources, applications that make
extensive use of images may potentially cause the system to become resource limited  on Windows 98
and Windows Me.  Efforts were made to minimize the impact of this in Eclipse, however, opening
several perspectives can still cause it to happen.  Further work in this area is ongoing.

<h4>
99.1.3 Available Colors on 8-bit Linux</h4>

Typically, in Gnome Linux installs running with 8 bit plain visuals (i.e. 256 color mode), before the 
Eclipse application is started, you already do not have any free colors.  This may mean that Eclipse
is unable to allocate the default widget background color causing it to display a white background. 
The functionality,  however, is not affected.

<h4>
99.1.4 Motif Accelerators</h4>

Keyboard accelerators on motif are sensitive to the state of all modifier keys such as the Caps Lock, 
Num Lock and Scroll Lock keys.  For example, Ctrl 'S' is not the same as Ctrl 'S' with the Num Lock key on.  
If keyboard accelerators appear to not be working, please check the state of all other modifier keys.

<h4>
99.1.5 Printing Support</h4>

Although printing is not used by Eclipse, SWT provides printing support on Win32 platforms.  
See org.eclipse.swt.printing for more information.

<h4>
99.1.6 Drag and Drop on Motif</h4>

On Motif, SWT only supports dragging between windows running on the same system process.  In particular, 
dragging a file between Eclipse and another application will cause the drop target application to hang.  This is a result of 
a bug in the Motif libraries for applications that are running multi-threaded (i.e. XInitThreads), which we have not yet been
able to workaround.

<h4>
99.1.7  Disposing in a Focus Event</h4>

Applications should not dispose widgets in focus changing events.  Doing so  on Motif may cause Eclipse to terminate,
since Motif accesses the disposed widget within their internal focus change event handler.
Similar but less serious issues exist on Windows such that occasionally an SWT exception can be thrown.
