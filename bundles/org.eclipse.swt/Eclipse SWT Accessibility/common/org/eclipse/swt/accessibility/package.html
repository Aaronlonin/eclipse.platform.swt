SWT Accessibility.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package contains the classes that support platform accessibility.
<br><b>Note</b>: this package is part of an interim API that is still under 
development and expected to change significantly before reaching stability. 
It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback from 
pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API 
will almost certainly be broken (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
