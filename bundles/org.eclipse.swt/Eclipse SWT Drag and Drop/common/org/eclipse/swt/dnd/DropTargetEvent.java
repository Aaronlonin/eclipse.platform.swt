/**
 * The DropTargetEvent contains the event information passed in the methods of the DropTargetListener.
 * 
 * <p>When in dragEnter(), dragOver(), dragLeave(), dragOperationChanged(), dropAccept(), 
 * the following fields apply:
 * <ul>
 * <li>(in)widget        - the object on which the data will be dropped if the mouse is released
 * <li>(in)time          - the time the drop occurred
 * <li>(in)x             - the x-cordinate of the cursor relative to the DropTarget <code>Control</code>
 * <li>(in)y             - the y-cordinate of the cursor relative to the DropTarget <code>Control</code>
 * <li>(in)dataTypes     - a list of the types of data that the DragSource can support
 * <li>(in,out)currentDataType - the specific type of data that will be provided on a drop
 * <li>(in)operations    - a list of the operations that the DragSource can support (e.g. DND.DROP_MOVE | DND.DROP_COPY | DND.DROP_LINK)
 * <li>(in,out)detail   - the operation being performed (one of DND.DROP_MOVE, DND.DROP_COPY, DND.DROP_LINK, DND.DROP_NONE)
 * </ul>
 * The application can change the operation that will be performed by modifying the <code>detail</code> field 
 * but the choice must be one of the values in the <code>operations</code> field.  
 * The application can also change the type of data being requested by modifying the <code>currentDataTypes</code>
 * field  but the value must be one of the values in the <code>dataTypes list</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>When in drop(), the following fields apply:
 * <ul>
 * <li>(in)widget   - the object on which the data was dropped
 * <li>(in)time     - the time the drop occurred
 * <li>(in)x        - the x-cordinate of the cursor relative to the DropTarget <code>Control</code>
 * <li>(in)y        - the y-cordinate of the cursor relative to the DropTarget <code>Control</code>
 * <li>(in,out)detail - the operation being performed (one of DND.DROP_MOVE, DND.DROP_COPY, DND.DROP_LINK, DND.DROP_NONE)
 * <li>(in)currentDataType - the specific type of data that is be contained in the <code>data</code> field
 * <li>(in)data     - the data (which is of type currentDataType); the type Java Object contained in this field is
 *						dependant on the Transfer subclass.  For example, the TextTransfer subclass provides a
 *						String with the text in the String.  The FileTransfer object provides an array of String with
 *						each String in the array containing the full path of the file.
 * </ul>
 * The application can cancel the drop operation by setting the detail field to DND.DROP_NONE.</p>
