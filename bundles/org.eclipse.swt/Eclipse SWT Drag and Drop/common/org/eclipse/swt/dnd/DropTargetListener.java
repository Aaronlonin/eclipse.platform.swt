/**
 * The <code>DropTargetListener</code> class provides event notification to the application for DropTarget events.
 *
 * <p>As the user moves the cursor into, over and out of a Control that has been designated as a DropTarget, events
 * indicate what operation can be performed and what data can be transferred if a drop where to occur at that point.
 * The application can respond to these events and change the type of data that will be dropped, change the operation 
 * that will be performed or stop any drop from happening on the current target.</p>
 *
 * <p>When the user causes a drop to happen by releasing the mouse over a valid drop target, the application has one 
 * last chance to change the data type of the drop through the DropAccept event.  If the drop is still allowed, the 
 * DropAccept event is immediately followed by the Drop event.  In the Drop event, the application can still change the
 * operation that is performed but the data type is fixed.</p>
