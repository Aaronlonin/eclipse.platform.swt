/**
 * The <code>TransferData</code> class is a platform specific data structure for describing the type and the
 * contents of data being transferred in a Drag and Drop operation.
 *
 * <p>As an application writer, you do not need to know anything about the specifics of TransferData.  You
 * should just pass the TransferData instances to subclass of Transfer and let the Transfer objects deal 
 * with the platform specific issues.  You can ask a Transfer subclass if it can handle this data by calling 
 * TextTransfer.isSupportedType(transferData).  You can get a list of the types of TransferData supported by a 
 * Transfer object by calling TextTransfer.getSupportedTypes().</p>
 *
 * <p>You should only need to become familiar with the fields in this class if you are implementing
 * a Transfer subclass and you are unable to subclass the ByteArrayTransfer class.</p>
