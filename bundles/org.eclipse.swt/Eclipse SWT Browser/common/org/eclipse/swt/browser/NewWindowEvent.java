/**
 * This event is sent to NewWindowListeners when a new Browser is
 * requested.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This event is typically sent when a script requesting a new
 * instance is executed. For example, the javascript command
 * <code>window.open("document.html", "Document")</code> will
 * trigger a NewWindow event when it is run.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The default behaviour is to ignore new window requests and cancel
 * the navigation request. To handle new window requests,
 * the application needs to create an instance of Browser and set it
 * into the NewWindowEvent.browser field.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * NOTE: The API in the browser package is NOT finalized.
 * Use at your own risk, because it will most certainly change.
 * The only reason this API is being released at this time is so that 
 * other teams can try it out.
